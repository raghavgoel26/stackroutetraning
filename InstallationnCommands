First of all install speecy ..go to CPU and check if virtualization is enabled ..If not reboot the system..go to BIOs..security..and then virtualization..enable both options that are shown..

then install atom

install gitbash

install virtual box

for installing vagrant go to stackroute github repository named vagrant-html-bootstrap

dowload zip

now in c: create a folder named vagrant n extarct that zip into this folder..

now open git bash

check pwd

now go to directory named vagrant we just created in c:

use cd c:/
    cd Vagrant/
    cd vagrant-html-bootstrap(Use tab for autofill)
    now type ls
    to check for files present inside

check for Vagrantfile

it is a file  written in ruby..

//////////* See comments *////
config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty32" //search for ubuntu version trusty32 in Vagrant cloud

//if not able to connect to cloud than we have provided the url for package we have uploaded on our local hoast
config.vm.box_url = "http://172.23.238.13/vagrant/boxes/trusty-server-cloudimg-i386-vagrant-disk1.box"

//we dont want our system to check for its updated version
config.vm.box_check_update = false

# Map the guest os port 8080 to host os port 8080
config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080

//now ubuntu is installed on virtual box..we want other tools like node to be installed..
//we create n call a puppet(created in different folder) for that..
# use puppet to provision this virtual box`
config.vm.provision :puppet do |puppet|
   puppet.manifests_path = "puppet/manifests"
   puppet.module_path = "puppet/modules"

// End of code

/////////*****************************************////////////

now in git bash
(we are already in the vagrant-htl-bootstrap-master directory )

type commands
vagrant up

//this is to start virtual box and loads ubuntu

vagrant ssh

//this is to take control inside ubuntu command prompt..

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install nodejs

sudo apt-get install npm

sudo npm install node-static -g

sudo ln -i /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node

//This creates a symbolic link

cd ../ ../vagrant

/vagrant$ ls

static -a 0.0.0.0

now run a browser

http://localhost:8080/index.html

//8080 is a port number of host that we mentioned in Vagrantfile..
//If we are making multiple virtual machines..than in Vagrantfile inside that new directory make change to
//to host port number..eg : 1234

than above link would become http://localhost:1234/index.html
